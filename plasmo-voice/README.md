## Available for all popular platforms

Paper, Folia, Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge servers are fully compatible with both Fabric and Forge clients.

To use voice chat, players must install the client-side mod for **Fabric**, **Forge** or **NeoForge**.
Players without the mod can still join the server and play as usual – they just won't have access to voice chat
features.
