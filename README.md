# Marallyzen
Marallyzen is a NeoForge Minecraft mod for roleplay: create NPCs from any entity, define them in JSON, assign patrols, dialogs, and scripts, and drive cinematic camera scenes. It ships a dialog GUI, DenizenCore scripting, runtime commands, and a public API so other mods can spawn NPCs, open dialogs, and play cutscenes. Includes examples for setup.!
