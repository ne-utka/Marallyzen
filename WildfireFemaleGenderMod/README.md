This mod adds extra customization options to the player model by adding breasts for a more feminine appearance.

This mod is primarily client-sided, but your settings will also be automatically synced with other connected players
if the mod is also installed on the server.

The mod also features cloud sync support (as of 4.0 on 1.21.2+) to allow for syncing your customization settings
to other players on servers that don't have the mod installed.

## Default Controls
H - Open Customization Settings

[Pre 1.21.6] G - Open Customization Settings

## Frequently Asked Question

<details>
<summary>1) Can you include a male bulge?</summary>

This mod is centered around female characters, so a male bulge won't be added.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2) If I were to play on a realm with my friends, and we all used this mod, would they see my character with my settings?</summary>

If everyone has **Cloud Sync** enabled, then yes. There is a delay in updating gender settings though, for performance reasons. We are going to actively monitor it to see if we can reduce or even possibly remove the delay in the future.

</details>

<details>
<summary>3) What about adding female butts?</summary>

No.

</details>

<details>
<summary>4) Any plans for additional breast models?</summary>

~~Yeah, I might introduce more breast models down the line. It's on the to-do list but not a top priority. Suggestions for unique ideas are welcome, as long as they're original and don't overlap with other mods.~~
This isn't planned anymore, though isn't entirely off the table.

</details>

<details>
<summary>5) Can we have larger breasts?</summary>

Nope. Stop asking. It isn't happening.

</details>

<details>
<summary>6) Will you port to past versions?</summary>

I am not providing support for past versions of Minecraft. The mod will only be developed on the most recent version of the game.

</details>

<details>
<summary>7) Is this mod compatible with Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (Mobile)?</summary>

No, and it never will be.

</details>

<details>
<summary>8) Why when I press 'H' ('G' in versions before 1.21.6) it opens the customization screen, and not the player list?</summary>

The option to edit other players' characters has been removed and will not be re-added. Modifying other players' characters without their consent is not recommended, and many people found it wrong to be able to do that. It was never intended to be a feature, it was just inherited from the UI design.

</details>

<details>
<summary>9) Could you change the player model's height or give it more curvy looking hips?</summary>

No, I don't want to edit the base game features. The breast model is an added layer to the default model. If I were to do a waist/torso thing, it would be editing the player model. It would also probably break compatibility with a lot more mods as well.
